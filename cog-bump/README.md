# cog-bump

This Github Action bumps tags your repository with the next [Semantic Version](https://semver.org/) for you repository by using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

This action uses [Cogogitto](https://github.com/cocogitto/cocogitto). Once a new version has been tagged you will need to push it to Github. Alternatively, you can configure Cocogitto to perform the push in a [`cog.toml`](https://docs.cocogitto.io/config/#general) file in your repository.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

You need to have your repository checked out with the full commit history and all tags. You you can do this with the following steps:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0
    # token is needed when branch protections are enabled on the target branch
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}
```

### Bumping the version

```yaml
- id: cog-bump
  uses: abhisheksr01/github-actions/cog-bump@v0.1.0 # Check the GitHub Repo Releases for latest version
```
